"To the people of Illinois: thank you for your trust in me once again.

I choose to fight for our state, our country, our world -- and the fight my mother never gave up on.

And I'm thrilled to work alongside you for four more years as your Governor."
"Abortion rights are human rights. Here in Illinois, we protect human rights."
"I’ve been in contact with DOD regarding operations across the Great Lakes region today. 

The US military has decommissioned another “object” over Lake Huron.

I appreciate the decisive action by our fighter pilots. 

The American people deserve far more answers than we have."
Steve is right - this dangerous rhetoric by the Speaker is unacceptable.
" Disgusting: Nancy Pelosi just called Republicans ""domestic enemies.”

I was shot because of this kind of unhinged rhetoric.

Where’s the media outrage?"
"Which of these mathematical facts is true?
 
A.) 81,283,485 > 74,223,744
B.) 306 > 232
C.) 51.4% > 46.9%
D.) All of the above
 
The correct answer is D. The facts will be upheld on January 6 and we will have a new POTUS on January 20 at 12 noon."
"Extremists applauding the illegal Canadian trucking blockade are really just cheering the loss of American jobs and higher prices for working families and small businesses.  We need strong and fully operational supply chains, not clogged bridges, roads, and sick workers."
"Wow! In face of GOP attempts to smear & distort Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's record, she was brilliant, principled, & proved she'll be a fair & impartial arbiter of justice. Bravo Judge Jackson! You stand on doorstep of history & inspire & open doors of opportunity for others."
"Today, Trump chose his ineffective wall over the needs of 120+ U.S. military bases and cut our efforts to counter Russia by undermining the European Deterrence Initiative, which is sure to please Putin but harms transatlantic security and our European allies."
"If an ambulance is behind you on the road racing to an emergency, do you move to the side so they can get by or block traffic because the ambulance is ‘infringing on your right to the road’? Being a patriot doesn’t mean giving up your rights, it means helping others. Wear a mask!"
"Now that Congress has passed the Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act, Pres Trump should sign it into law. The American people stand w/ the people of Hong Kong, who should be free to peacefully express their democratic rights without being violently repressed."
"Blame for the violent assault on our democracy lies w/ those who spread phony conspiracies & failed to refute Trump's lies or hold him accountable. Many in GOP enabled falsehoods to fester. Now, GOP must come clean about Trump’s lies & uphold truth, justice, & the rule of law."
"I urge Pres Trump to sign the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act. It's the right thing to do & would show China that U.S. doesn't back down from upholding #humanrights or democracy. The American people clearly stand w/ people of Hong Kong, even if Trump does not."
"Visited the grave of my friend’s father and witnessed a remarkable ceremony. The letters on the white crosses almost disappear in the brightness of the stone, so a soldier fills the indentations with sand from Omaha Beach to bring the name forward. It sent shivers down my spine."
Devin Nunes calling the Intelligence Committee’s fact-finding mission a cult is dispicable. I know about cults. Cults are led by maniacal narcissists who expect complete adoration and relinquishment of independent thought. I suggest Mr. Nunes look elsewhere.

Disgusting when Rod Rosenstein says “mistakes.” The Russia hoax was not a mistake.  It was a coordinated effort and people should be prosecuted for it.

"A short while ago, men such as Robert Mueller, William Taylor, and Alexander Vindman would have been pin-ups for (us) American conservatives: decorated combat veterans; patriots; straight arrows. The urge to prop up Trump changed all of this. A heartbreaking and infuriating era."
"Listening to these hearings, you can see why Republicans, both in electoral politics and in the media, worked so very hard to keep them from ever coming about."

"As Florida now ranks lowest in the continental U.S. in terms of COVID-19 rates per capita, we are proud to have stood firm in protecting liberty throughout the pandemic. @GovRonDeSantis’ approach was guided by science, data, and pragmatism, not fear and alarmist narratives."
".@GovRonDeSantis and I took an oath to uphold the rule of law.

"3 years ago today, I was sworn-in as Florida's 20th and first Hispanic female Lieutenant Governor. 

I remain committed to putting Floridians first and fighting alongside @GovRonDeSantis in keeping Florida free."
SCOTUS striking down Biden’s OSHA vaccine mandate is a great step in the right direction. As @GovRonDeSantis and I have said — one's employment should never be contingent on a shot.

The Constitution anticipates a President like this. It does not anticipate a Congress so indifferent to a President like this.
"Q: So when did the DOJ start treating removal of classified documents like a felony anyway?
A: When President Trump signed a 2018 law making it a felony."
"I taught in West Baltimore. I adore my kids, their parents, and grandparents. They all want the same thing I want for my kids: the chance for their children to have safe, happy and productive lives. Let’s think about the language we use, who it hurts."

".@realDonaldTrump has called Michigan’s legislative leaders to the WH to overturn the will of the Michigan’s voters. This is not just crazy, it’s potentially a crime.  I’d turn the plane around.  Or wear a wire."
I’m honored that President-elect @joeBiden has placed his faith in me as his Energy Secretary nominee.  We have an opportunity to build back better while creating millions of jobs — we can do it!

This is racism.
I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...
I am sorry to not be able to stay in Washington for the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial but I need to be home with my wife at this time. We have many decisions to make as a family. I have every faith in my colleagues and hope the Senate will do what is right.
" @realDonaldTrump is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of CA. Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth largest economy in the world, are not impressed."
" Thanks for the shout-out, @realDonaldTrump. But bridges are still better than walls. And California remains the 6th largest economy in the world and the most prosperous state in America. #Facts"

Handing the reins over to @GavinNewsom. And now off to the ranch for the next chapter.
This vote will live in infamy. It eviscerates the last vestige of Congressional integrity and does irreparable damage to our once proud Republican Party. It will not stand. #GOPTaxScam
"This proposal, which incorporates provisions similar to legislation I introduced earlier this month with @SenRobPortman, includes widely supported solutions that both sides of the aisle agree on. Congress must consider this proposal with a real sense of urgency."
"When I took the oath at the beginning of the trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution & the law. I took this oath & responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and the president’s lawyers."

Hillary Clinton belongs in the White House. Donald Trump belongs on my show.
"I'm sorry, but Trump's behavior is not just beneath the dignity of the Presidency...but that of any decent man."
"While I may not be able to moderate a debate, sounds like Mike Pence and Donald Trump might need to come on my show to talk things out."
C'mon Donald... you complaining about Hillary's temperament is like me complaining about the quality of television!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
"Hey @kanyewest, @wizkhalifa and @DaRealAmberRose, don't fight! I think you should settle this on my show."
The RNC Convention is just a parody of my show. Even the chanting. This is not how we run a country!
"Donald Trump, running for president, said he has great temperament and the audience LAUGHED."
"Happy birthday ""grandson"" Louis Tomlinson of One Direction from Grandpa Jerry Springer. Say ""hi"" to the guys."

He insults John Lewis on MLK Day. He bans refugees on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Can he be any more un-American? Disgraceful.
Talk about stamina... Donald Trump can't pay attention for this whole debate.
"No matter your politics, it's clear Hillary is ready and capable to be president and Trump isn't."

"A police officer pulls down a black man’s mask to pepper spray him! His hands were up, not behaving in any threatening way. This is outrageous."

"I love you, Jilly, and I couldn’t be more grateful to have you with me on the journey ahead."
Biden's team won't let him do interviews. He made 2 short teleprompter speeches in Missouri this weekend & both generated massive gaffes that went viral. You can't beat Trump by trying to hide to avoid the issue of #BidensCognitiveDecline. How is this not a massive red flag?
"They lied to you about Vietnam.
They lied to you about Iraq.
They lied to you about Syria.
They lied to you about Honduras.
They lied to you about Libya.

So why would you believe what they're saying about Venezuela?"
"I just left the White House where I was briefed by CoS @MarkMeadows and top intelligence officials. They discussed @nytimes' hit piece falsely accusing @realDonaldTrump of ignoring reports that Russia placed bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.

A thread, "
So it turns out that all along it was the Bidens colluding with Russia!
"Barack Obama despised our military and loathed it’s leadership. 

Donald Trump rebuilt our military, prioritized the care of our veterans and adopted Reagan’s “Peace thru Strength” mantra in a way that would make the Gipper proud. 

Actions speak louder than anonymous sources."
"Given the stakes of this election, if Paul Ryan isn't for Trump, then I'm not for Paul Ryan."
