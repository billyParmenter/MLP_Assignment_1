"Folks, @ChuckGrassley just launched his first attack ad against me. 

He called me: ""too radical for Iowa.""

Senator, what's really radical is being in office for 60 years and STILL thinking you're the solution."
"BREAKING The GOP just tried to knock me off the ballot. They failed. 

They’re scared because I'm the biggest threat @ChuckGrassley has faced in decades.

Today, they lost their challenge—and they better get used to losing. Together, we're going to retire Chuck Grassley."
"The GOP’s attempts to undermine ballot access and our election process were pathetic and desperate.

Today they lost.

With a unanimous decision by the Iowa Supreme Court, we're still in this fight and we WILL beat Chuck Grassley in November.

It's a good day for our democracy."
"A man first elected in the 1950s is blocking equal pay protections for women in 2022. His name?

It’s with a heavy heart I am calling for the sake of our Democracy that the 25th Amendment be invoked.  My statement:
I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President.  This is beyond repugnant.
"....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.” Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews"
"I haven’t yet said this publically, but I want to now.  On Wednesday I felt literally and real evil as the insurrection went down.  It is not something that happens much, but I’ve never felt it stronger than that day.  Mass deception."
The prosecution is compelling.  Donald Trump incited and directed the insurrection.  He knew what he was doing.  I cannot imagine how any Senator could vote against removal.
"Today, I was asked to serve on the bipartisan January 6th Select Committee and I humbly accepted. When duty calls, I will always answer. https://bit.ly/3zy5TcP"
"I say this to the President, and his defenders in Congress:

You may think it’s okay how Trump and his associates interacted with Russians during the campaign.

I don’t.

I think it’s immoral. I think it’s unethical. I think it’s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it’s corrupt."
"Mr. President, I see you’ve had a busy morning of “Executive Time.” Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else."
"Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!"
"Donald Trump must be convicted and removed from office.

Because he will always choose his own personal interest over our national interest.
 
Because in America, right matters. Truth matters.
 
If not, no Constitution can protect us.

If not, we are lost."
"My colleague @IlhanMN fights each day to improve the lives of people throughout America. The comments from Tucker Carlson last night are vile. He spews racist, bigoted, and xenophobic views that make our country worse."
"I misspoke this morning, I do believe we should do everything we can to force the Senate to have a fair trial.  If the Speaker believes that holding on to the articles for a longer time will help force a fair trial in the Senate, then I wholeheartedly support that decision."
"The President is deliberately sabotaging the @USPS to prevent people from safely voting from home in the middle of a pandemic.

This is voter suppression no matter which way you cut it."
Trump admits he's sabotaging the Postal Service so universal mail voting will be impossible during an election that will be conducted amid a pandemic this November
"President Trump incited & encouraged this riot. He & his enablers are responsible for the despicable attack at the Capitol.

VP Pence and the Cabinet should invoke the 25th amendment to remove Trump, otherwise Senate Republicans must work with the House to impeach & remove him."

Today’s election results mark a significant turning point for the future of Brazil and demonstrate the power of democracy to advance progress for our planet and its people. (1/2)
"Today’s decision is a disappointment, but it's not a surprise. It's the result of coordination by the fossil fuel lobby to dismantle progress toward climate solutions. This ruling does not mean we are out of options! We must call on Congress to pass climate legislation. 1/2"
A superb choice by President-elect @JoeBiden of @JohnKerry as Climate Envoy. Kerry’s experience and passion are exactly what we need to restore American leadership abroad and repair the alliances that are crucial to solving the climate crisis.

"Nancy Pelosi has been the greatest, most effective Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in American history. Thank you @SpeakerPelosi for your dedicated service and leadership."
The Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to be a historic turning point. It represents the single largest investment in climate solutions & environmental justice in US history. Decades of tireless work by climate advocates across the country led to this moment. 1/3
"In America, no one person or political party can alter the unassailable principle that the rule of law prevails. Every vote must be counted in this election, and the will of the American people will determine the outcome. We must remain calm. Democracy will win the day."
"Senators should reject Mike Pompeo’s nomination to be Secretary of State. He denies the climate crisis, and has been doing the bidding for fossil fuel interests his whole career. The American people deserve better."
"Reminder: Despite President Trump’s best efforts, the U.S. cannot officially withdraw from the #ParisAgreement until one day after the next Presidential election. And then it takes just 30 days for a new President to get us back in. This decision is in the hands of the voters."
"Today on the floor of the Congress of the United States of America, I will call for the Impeachment of the President between 9am & 10am CST."
"Because of an impeached, reckless, ruthless, lawless, shameless, corrupt, & unapologetically bigoted president - who is still engaging in a coverup, the state of the House, the state of the Senate, and the #StateOfTheUnion are divided.

Trump says I’m a troublemaker & con man. I do make trouble for bigots. If he really thought I was a con man he would want me in his cabinet.
Let us all pray for Rev. and Mrs Jesse Jackson. They need our sincere and intense prayers. Prayer changes things!!!
"This week, in the spirit of unity, I made a moral appeal to the @WhiteHouse to consider the homeless & incarcerated amid #COVID19. To my surprise, @realDonaldTrump called me to discuss it. If Trump can call a critic like Al Sharpton, we can *all* find it in us to come together."

Just going to leave this here...
It bears repeating again and again... the filibuster isn't a part of the Constitution... but THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS.
"To my fellow Senators, let's be honest - in order to do much of what we were sent to Washington to do - we HAVE to leverage our power. Mitch McConnell has shown us who he is time and time again, holding out for compromise is a fool's errand. We MUST end the filibuster."
RT if you believe vote by mail should be available to all voters no matter what state they live in.
Say it with me: End the Filibuster to Save Our Democracy.
I STRONGLY SUPPORT ELIMINATING THE FILIBUSTER TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY. SHARE IF YOU AGREE.
Immigrants make America great.
Again for those in the back: THE FILIBUSTER IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE CONSTITUTION AND HAS BECOME AN UNTENABLE STUMBLING BLOCK FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. IT MUST GO.
I will keep saying this until it no longer needs to be said: PRESERVING THE FILIBUSTER IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY.
END THE FILIBUSTER. PASS THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT.
I'll keep saying it because it's true: PRESERVING THE FILIBUSTER IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY.
Nowhere in America should it be illegal to pass out water to those waiting in line to vote. RT if you agree.
I will continue to say this loud and clear: the filibuster is fundamentally undemocratic and must be eliminated.
I will continue to stand with President @realDonaldTrump and expose this sham impeachment process.
Today I was once again denied the opportunity to attend the secret so-called impeachment hearings. I will continue to fight on behalf my constituents and expose this sham process and stand with President Donald Trump.

My favorite text of the week so far from a constituent watching the House floor proceedings was from my wife.
"Woke up thinking about the fact that 157 – nearly 77% – of my Republican colleagues voted yesterday against my own family continuing to be recognized under the law – including two of my colleagues from Minnesota. 

I guess family values only apply to some families."

"President Biden called Rep. Angie Craig — who was assaulted last week in her DC apartment building — to offer his support for her, according to a person familiar with the matter. Vice President Harris called Craig Thursday afternoon, the source said."
"My wife Cheryl and I got married in 2008, but our marriage was not recognized by the federal government for seven more years.

Today I voted to pass the Respect for Marriage Act because I know firsthand that politicians have no business deciding who you can love or marry."
The President should not serve another day in office. I encourage members of his Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him. We must defend our nation and preserve our democracy.
".@RepMTG - on behalf of every adoptive mother in America - you are a disgrace and embarrassment to this body.

You want to come tell me to my face that I'm not a mother to my adopted son either?"
Marjorie Taylor Greene says that adopted or parents through marriage aren’t real parents because they’re “not biological.” She just told a witness who is a mother through marriage that she is “not a mother.”
My statement on Rep. Gabbard's hateful piece of legislation:
.@AOC is exactly right. It’s an outrage that Minnesotans who care for adult dependents & children older than 16 are getting shortchanged. I led the charge to correct this oversight back in May – but the admin has refused to cooperate. The American people deserve an explanation.
"We were also told the reason adult dependents (ppl w/ disabilities, college students, etc) were left out from survival checks again is bc Trump wants checks ASAP & said including adult dependents would “slow it down,” so he flat out refused - but that excuse doesn’t make sense /1"

I fully support the Speaker’s announcement of a new impeachment inquiry. The circumstances surrounding the President’s phone call with a foreign leader requires it and we are obligated to go wherever the facts lead.
The times have found us. The actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution. It is for this reason that the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.
My staff and I are safe. Praying for an end to this violence.

The worst one term president in American history.
According to my calculations @kanyewest’s presidential aspirations lasted one full Scaramucci
They are planning another attack. The President and his conspiracists need to be arrested.
One Scaramucci left for Trump.
"Trump asked the black community “what do you have to lose?” in voting for him. Turns out, your life."
Donald Trump is going to jail.
"Trump campaign said 1 million tickets requested. 20,000 seat arena is maybe half full. Outdoor event cancelled. Sad when the farewell tour doesn’t sell out."
He is telling people to get tough from his “bunker.” Coward in Chief
Liz Truss lasted 4.1 Scaramuccis
The arena isn’t filled. He is a wreck. He should drop out.
We are two (2) full Scaramucci’s out from having a new President-elect.
"We live in a country where a 79-year-old scientist and doctor who has dedicated 36 years of his life to understanding and stopping infectious disease, now needs armed federal security because his life is threatened for telling the truth about a pandemic. Vote him out!"
Never forget how dangerous and abnormal this all was.

"So, to sum up the Supreme Court’s week: life begins at conception and ends in a mass shooting."
This is why social distancing is so important right now. Share with your loved ones.
Does it bother anyone that our President violently raped a 13 year old?
"“Jane Doe” alleges Donald Trump sexually assaulted her on four separate occasions, culminating in a rape when she was just 13 at Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion. 

Her evidence? Three sworn declarations – from her, a friend she confided in at the time, AND one of Epstein’s recruiters."
"Our family been battling COVID for 10 days now.

And, it has absolutely flattened us.

"I guarantee you there will be angry men at the NRA convention.

"We need to talk a lot less about red and blue.
We need to talk a lot more about whiteness."
"2/3s of Republicans in Congress signed onto a lawsuit attempting to disenfranchise millions of voters, and somehow @Kaepernick7 was the one disrespecting our American values?

"The @GOP should clarify that there is no pledge to support a nominee if they are found guilty of espionage or a serious felony.

Donald Trump is the target of an ongoing criminal investigation and he should step aside & put the good of the country above his candidacy."
I have spoken with Col. Bill Bryant of the Arkansas State Police and the local arrest incident in Crawford County will be investigated pursuant to the video evidence and the request of the prosecuting attorney.
"Trump is correct on Biden’s failures, but his self-indulging message promoting anger has not changed. It didn’t work in 2022 and won’t work in 2024. There are better choices."
"President Biden’s visit to the heart of Ukraine is a good moment for America as we show bipartisan support for those in Ukraine fighting for freedom, democracy & their very lives. The GOP must not waver in our support for those standing against oppression."
The search at Mar-a Lago of a former President is unprecedented & alarming.   We must see the probable cause affidavit before making a judgment. Normally that would be under seal but since Trump announced  the raid then the probable cause should be made public.

"Guilty until proven innocent. That, my friends, is the way they do it in China, Venezuela, Cuba, and against @realDonaldTrump in the U.S. House of Representatives under @SpeakerPelosi."
"Pelosi is opening a liquor store in the House where Members can buy alcohol with their taxpayer-funded MRAs.

All while Americans are struggling to pay for food? Outrageous."
"Unless @SpeakerPelosi & @SenSchumer deny Congress a chance to vote on @POTUS proposal it will pass. The Schumer/Pelosi games are hurting fed workers, allowing criminal activity along our border & holding up disaster assistance. They say they want to open the gov, then let’s vote."
How did Afghanistan’s fall happen in mere hours? Congress needs to know the facts. @SpeakerPelosi must call Congress back now. Tough questions need to be asked & answered. Anything else is nothing other than partisan protection of Biden regardless of the consequences to America.

"Some people ask: Why would you impeach and convict a president who has only a few days left in office? The answer: Precedent. It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government."
Let us go forward together. The struggle continues.
"Trump just had peaceful demonstrators viciously attacked.  No, Mr. President. This is not a dictatorship. This is the United States of America. Our citizens have a constitutional right to peacefully protest. It's called the First Amendment."

I think we may have to account for the distinct possibility that the people who sounded the most apocalyptic about Trump were not being hysterical - they were right.
For the media. We need you to step up and describe what is happening to our country. Use the words. “Authoritarian.” “Unlawful.” “Autocratic” “Illegal.” It’s not “dramatic” or “trumpian.” Or “risky.” This isn’t a show.
"THE ACTUAL MATH! Just so we’re clear, Congress could send each American $2,000 EVERY MONTH UNTIL MAY 2021 for less than the cost of the two early Congressional Corporate Covid Handouts. This is not about money. It’s about greed and hurting people. McConnell & the GOP want this."

We are calling up a resolution that condemns Chairman Adam Schiff and the way he has abused his power to mislead the American people. Read the complete censure resolution here:
"Democrats just blocked my bill to lower gas prices by unleashing U.S. energy independence for a SIXTH time.

DNC has already announced that it will not allow any debates in 2024 primary. Biden is not to be challenged. Everyone on the Democratic side must shut up and fall in line. Not having debates is undemocratic and ridiculous. No progressive should agree to this kind of power grab.

"We must hold @RepAdamSchiff accountable for misleading the American people with lies.

" I just requested a vote on legislation that would stop the Biden administration from sending our Strategic Petroleum Reserves to China. 
 
Every single Democrat just voted to put China’s national security over our own."
"President Trump was, without question, a driving force in the catastrophic events that took place on January 6 by encouraging masses of rioters to incite violence on elected officials, staff members, and our representative democracy as a whole."

I just voted to hold Adam Schiff accountable. Democrats blocked the censure resolution.
I voted against the $1.7 trillion omnibus. I’m looking forward to new leadership in the House in January. We must do better.
Under the Constitution the authority to launch impeachment rests with the U.S. House of Representatives—not with the Speaker and not with the Chair of House Intelligence.

"Hey @SenTomCotton - heard you on @hughhewitt criticizing the Jan 6 hearings.

Then you said the strangest thing; you admitted you hadn’t watched any of them.

Here’s a tip: actually watching them before rendering judgment is more consistent with “Anglo-American jurisprudence.”"
"As we heard yesterday, WH counsel Pat Cippollone had significant concerns re. Trump’s Jan 6 activities. It’s time for Mr. Cippollone to testify on the record. Any concerns he has about the institutional interests of his prior office are outweighed by the need for his testimony."
The January 6th Select Committee has not issued a conclusion regarding potential criminal referrals. We will announce a decision on that at an appropriate time.

Disgusting when Rod Rosenstein says “mistakes.” The Russia hoax was not a mistake.  It was a coordinated effort and people should be prosecuted for it.
So Dems voted AYE to release their memo and NAY to the Republican memo. Republicans vote AYE to release both memos. Who was fair/balanced? #ReleaseTheMemo
This is the majority
An ARMY of volunteers in Minneapolis helping neighbors clean up business damage. “Bring a broom” they were told.  What a sight.

"I grew up a hunter and served as an Army Ranger. 

I didn’t take my deer hunting rifle to Afghanistan, nor did I take my assault rifle deer hunting. 

Don’t be fooled by the gun lobby. The type of gun matters. 

Weapons of war have no place in our communities."
"New rule: If you brought us to this point by peddling The Big Lie, you don’t get to preach about “healing” and “unity.”

Healing and unity always require truth and accountability."
"He’s broke, he lives in our house, and he’s been stealing from us."
"Patriotism isn't about making everyone stand and salute the flag.

Patriotism is about making this a country where everyone wants to."
The President said he was going to run America like his businesses. Apparently we have reached the part where he would usually just declare bankruptcy and run away. #TrumpShutdown
"Dear Nancy,

Thanks for wasting five months of our lives.

Very insincerely,
Literally everyone"
"After what happened to the McCloskeys because of an overzealous prosecutor in St. Louis, I introduced legislation that federally guarantees American families have the right to defend their home and their private property.

RT if you believe  Congress must pass this bill!"
I’m not going to let personal attacks from the president distract me from what matters: beating this virus and keeping Washingtonians healthy.
"Washington state will act under our own authority, our own laws and our own jurisdiction to protect #NetNeutrality for all of Washington's citizens."
"Trust me, my friends: If a Democratic president did this, all of us conservatives would explode in rage -- this usurpation, this defilement of the people's house -- and we'd be right."
The South Lawn.
"From a conservative who has been disgusted by the Trumpified GOP: “I didn’t think I could drag myself to the polls. But after the Left’s performance in the Kavanaugh affair, I would crawl across broken glass.” I believe this sentiment is common."
"Reminder: McCain was shot down on his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam. Fractured his arms and a leg, almost drowned. Tortured, for years. Two years of solitary confinement. Endured more than most of us could ever imagine. Very, very tough guy. Patriot. Hero. A real man."
"A short while ago, men such as Robert Mueller, William Taylor, and Alexander Vindman would have been pin-ups for (us) American conservatives: decorated combat veterans; patriots; straight arrows. The urge to prop up Trump changed all of this. A heartbreaking and infuriating era."
"Listening to these hearings, you can see why Republicans, both in electoral politics and in the media, worked so very hard to keep them from ever coming about."
"Josh Hawley calls for a ""new nationalism."" I have a feeling that this is a politics that does not respect our democracy, including our election results. This strikes me as a politics that pumps its fist in encouragement of the mob. Keep an eye on Hawley and his ism. 1/2"
"This morning, I passed my neighbor, who was walking his dog. He uses a walker now and moves very slowly. He is incredibly tough. On his forearm is a tattoo -- not the kind the kids get. I stared at that faded number this morning, and my stupid, shitty problems melted."

Criticizing a candidate on the issues is part of politics. Threatening my children is not. We are thankful for the support of law enforcement as we work to find whoever is behind this gutless act. We will not be intimidated as we work to make #NJ11 better for everyone.

I am proud to serve as the first Latina lieutenant governor of the great state of Florida — and I am offended by the term Latinx.
"As Florida now ranks lowest in the continental U.S. in terms of COVID-19 rates per capita, we are proud to have stood firm in protecting liberty throughout the pandemic. @GovRonDeSantis’ approach was guided by science, data, and pragmatism, not fear and alarmist narratives."
".@GovRonDeSantis and I took an oath to uphold the rule of law. 

Since the Biden administration won’t secure our border, we will continue to find ways to keep our communities safe while empowering sanctuary cities to assist with the humanitarian crisis at the southern border."
"3 years ago today, I was sworn-in as Florida's 20th and first Hispanic female Lieutenant Governor. 

I remain committed to putting Floridians first and fighting alongside @GovRonDeSantis in keeping Florida free."
SCOTUS striking down Biden’s OSHA vaccine mandate is a great step in the right direction. As @GovRonDeSantis and I have said — one's employment should never be contingent on a shot.
"Pray for Ukraine. 

Pray for Taiwan. 

Pray for freedom fighters everywhere."
"Citizens of Hong Kong are fighting against a tyrannical communist government. Books about democracy are banned. Lifetime prison sentences are handed out like candy.
If freedom is handed over to the government, it is extremely difficult to get it back.

Thank you to the best grassroots campaign this state has ever seen. I will forever be grateful.
I’m calling for a hearing with the U.S. interpreter who was present during President Trump’s meeting with Putin to uncover what they discussed privately. This interpreter can help determine what @POTUS shared/promised Putin on our behalf.
"I want to know where the outrage was when, year after year, I and others in the Senate tried to get more SIVs to protect our Afghan allies, or when the Trump administration was giving away the rights of Afghan women and girls during peace talks with the Taliban."

As the author of the bill implementing amend 4 it was our intent that those ineligible would be granted some grace by the state if they registered without intent to commit voter fraud.  Some of the individuals did check with SOEs and believed they could register. #Intentmatters
"In 2020, FL ran one of the most secure & transparent elections in the US, but we have more work to do. That's why I established an election crimes unit. 

@fdlepio has charged 20 murderers & sex offenders who weren't eligible to vote w/ election fraud. They face 5 yrs in prison."
"The approach of 'The beatings will continue until morale improves' is counterproductive. The more difficult it becomes for companies to leave, the greater their reluctance to invest more.  Address the question of why are they leaving!"
Great news! @realDonaldTrump has DENIED Minnesota's disaster request to repair half a billion dollars in damage from the riots. Governors and Mayors who ordered police to stand down and watch their cities burn shouldn't get a penny in taxpayer aid!
"None of what Democrats said happened on the call between @realDonaldTrump & Ukrainian President Zelensky was true. No quid pro quo, no talk of aid, no crimes committed. They moved to impeach yesterday before they even knew the facts."
"On January 6, 2021, I plan to object to the Electoral College certification for the people of the Third District of South Carolina and the millions of Americans who are demanding transparency into the 2020 Election. FULL STATEMENT:"
"Having read “The Memo,” the FBI is right to have “grave concerns” - as it will shake the organization down to its core - showing Americans just how the agency was weaponized by the Obama officials/DNC/HRC to target political adversaries. #ReleaseTheMemo"
"Now Pelosi & Schiff want to pretend they are being transparent—after they corrupted & tainted the process for weeks in secret, keeping information from Members of Congress & the American people. Give me a break. Seems a little late for that."

Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!
"In Mr. O’Rourke’s own backyard, thousands of patriots came out to show their support for @tedcruz last night. They know what we all know - Senator Cruz is the clear choice to keep America safe and free and to #KeepTexasStrong"
"BREAKING: When I get back to DC next week, I will be introducing an amendment to the defense bill with @RonWyden to stop the Trump administration from sending its paramilitary squads onto America's streets. We won't let these authoritarian tactics stand."
"I read the FBI report.  This whole thing is a sham.  This stunted, strangled investigation was designed to provide cover, not to provide the truth."
.@realDonaldTrump: Get your DHS lackey and uninvited paramilitary actions out of my state. Our communities are not a stage for your twisted reelection campaign.
"I was barred entry. Asked repeatedly to speak to a supervisor—he finally came out and said he can’t tell us anything. Police were called on us.
